-Program has a set list of denominations(Rs1, Rs2, Rs5, Rs10, Rs20, Rs50, Rs100)

-Program prompts for bill to be paid

-Program prompts for amount paid

-Program outputs most efficient form of change





EXAMPLE:

Bill to be paid: 67

Payment made: 100

Your change is:

Rs20  Rs10  Rs2  Rs1 


---> Program doesnt work with paise and other decimal denominations for now due to strange decimal errors during subtraction for change, resulting from the lack of proper representation for certain decimal values in the language(1 - 0.7 will give 0.30000000004)
