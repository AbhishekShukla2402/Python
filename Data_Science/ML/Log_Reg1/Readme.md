This is an implementation of Logistic regression on a dataset detailing various attributes of a family of mushroom and their classification under the edible or poisonous bracket. While initially intending to be more of an endevour in tinkering with model parameters to produce the most accurate results possible, it ended up demonstrating the importance of a very crucial concept in classification, Encoding, LabelEncoding vs One Hot Encoding to be more precise. The program attempts to perform Classification of mushrooms based on the various parameters provided, an exercise in supervised machine learning. The data was sourced directly from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom and an additional information file is provided in the form of a csv detailing the parameter description.
