This project implements a spam filter using Logistic Regression in the following ways:

- a dataset containing only spam messages was extracted from the main dataset
- a list of 25 most common words appearing in the spam messages was created
- each and every message in the dataset was then assigned a score based on the words contained and whether they made an appearence on the spam list.
- a model was trained to detect spam on the basis of the score
- model was hypertuned for maximum accuracy

The final accuracy score for the Logistic Regression model was 91%
